## 📝 Task 7 – SPECKit Plus

## 🔰 What is SPECKit Plus? – Short Note
**SPECKit Plus** is a structured software development framework used in AI-Driven Development.  
It divides a project into **five clear phases**—constitution, specify, plan, tasks, and implement.  
The goal is to help developers think, design, and build systematically.  
This approach increases clarity, reduces errors, and ensures high-quality, predictable results.

# 📘 1️⃣ /constitution
The **constitution phase** sets the foundation of the entire project.  
Here we define:

- The problem we are solving  
- The target users  
- The mission, vision, and goals  
- The value the project will deliver  

This phase gives the project clear direction and purpose.

---

# ✏ 2️⃣ /specify 
The **specify phase** defines detailed project requirements.  
This includes:

- Features  
- User flows  
- Acceptance criteria  
- Technical needs  
- Constraints  

This step ensures everyone understands exactly what must be built.

---

# 🧠 3️⃣ /plan 
The **plan phase** converts the requirements into a structured execution roadmap.  
In this step, we:

- Break features into modules  
- Decide timelines and milestones  
- Choose tools and technologies  
- Identify risks  
- Plan architecture and workflow  

This makes development organized and predictable.

# 📝 4️⃣ /tasks 
The **tasks phase** breaks the plan into actionable, small tasks.  
Each task is:

- Clear  
- Specific  
- Measurable  

Tasks help developers build the project piece-by-piece without confusion.

---

# ⚙ 5️⃣ /implement 
The **implement phase** is where real development takes place.  
Developers:

- Write code  
- Build features  
- Test functionality  
- Fix bugs  
- Integrate modules  

The final output is a working software product that matches the original plan and specification.
