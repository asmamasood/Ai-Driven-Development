# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
# Phase 1 – Constitution (Simple Calculator Project)

## 📝 Project Title

**Simple Calculator**

## 🎯 Goal

A basic, easy-to-use calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations including:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

## 📌 Project Purpose

The purpose of this calculator is to allow users to input two numbers and choose an operation, then receive an accurate and clear output.

## 📘 Mission

To create a reliable, user-friendly, and error-free calculator using the 5 AI-driven development phases of SPECKitPlus.

## 🧩 Scope

This project will include:

* Input handling
* Arithmetic operations
* Clean console output
* Error handling

## 🛑 Rules & Constraints

* The calculator must accept **two numeric inputs**.
* The user must be able to select **one operation** at a time.
* Incorrect inputs (non-numeric or invalid operation) must show appropriate error messages.
* Division by zero must be safely handled.
* Code must be simple, readable, and beginner-friendly.

## ✔ Success Criteria

* The calculator runs without errors.
* All four operations work correctly.
* User receives clear instructions and output.
* Test cases validate proper functionality.

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

* Keep the logic clean and modular.
* Focus on clarity instead of complexity.
* Provide meaningful error messages.
* Follow AI-driven workflow steps carefully.


<!-- ## Core Principles -->

<!-- ### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

### [PRINCIPLE_6_NAME]


[PRINCIPLE__DESCRIPTION]

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->**Version**: [CONSTITUTION_VERSION] | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]
Example: Version: 2.1.1 | Ratified: 2025-06-13 | Last Amended: 2025-07-16 -->
